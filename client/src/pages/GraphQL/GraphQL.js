                        How REST works
                    </h3>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                         A RESTful API is a set of rules that developers follow when creating application interfaces. It allows the 
                         client to communicate with server and retrieve important data. The client makes a <span>request</span> to the server 
                         by providing a custom <span>URL</span>. The URL is made up of two parts, an <span>endpoint</span> and a 
                         <span> path.</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                         The endpoint is simply the starting point of the API youâ€™re requesting from. For example, in our calorie application 
                         we would be making requests to <span>localhost:4000</span> in when development and thus
                         our endpoint would be:
                    </p>
                    <div className="TestingArticle__terminal-container">
                        <div className="GraphQL__non-terminal-code">
                            /localhost:4000
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                         The <span>path</span> allows us to specify exactly what resource we are requesting. For instance, in our, let's say 
                         will need to fetch the nutritional information of a banana. To achieve this, we would append the following path 
                         to the endpoint.
                    </p>
                    <div className="TestingArticle__terminal-container">
                        <div className="GraphQL__non-terminal-code">
                            /localhost:4000<span>/food/nutrition/bananaID</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                         With this path, the server can figure out exactly what resource you are looking for, retrieve it, and then send it to you.
                         The diagram below illustrates exactly what we've done here.
                    </p>

                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        Notice that in a RESTful API, the server is completely <span>seperated</span> from the client. Thus we can manipulate 
                        the code in the client without having it effecting the server, and vice-versa. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        There are two common limitations of a RESTful API. Firstly, if we want to fetch multiple pieces of data with different paths, we 
                        are forced to perform <span> multiple round requests</span> to the server. For example, let's say we want the to know the calories
                        of both a banana and a cheesecake. To do so, we will have to make the following requests:
                    </p>
                    <div className="TestingArticle__terminal-container">
                        <div className="GraphQL__non-terminal-code">
                            /localhost:4000<span>/food/nutrition/bananaID</span>
                        </div>
                        <div className="GraphQL__non-terminal-code">
                            /localhost:4000<span>/food/nutrition/cheeseCakeID</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        Secondly, more often than not, we end up <span>over-fetching</span> data. Recall from the <a href="#graphql-diagram-1">scerenio </a>
                        above that we only wanted to know the calories of the banana, but instead we got back a JSON object with additional information.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        If you aren't a fan of these limitations, this would be the time to bring in <span>GraphQL</span>.

                        How GraphQL works
                    </h3>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        As stated before, GraphQL works a little bit differently from the conventional REST API. Instead of making your requests with URL's, with
                        GraphQL you describe exactly the data that you want by writing <span>queries</span>. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        This is great, because now you have the ability to access many different resources with only <span>one request</span>. Furthermore,
                        you're getting exactly what you ask for, not more, and not less.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                       To perform any of the <span>CRUD</span> operations we can write simple <span>mutations</span> that allows you to describe exactly 
                       how you want your data to change. When you pair GraphQL with <span>Prisma</span> (an ORM we'll discuss later), you don't even have to write out any of the 
                       tedicious CRUD logic, as it'll all be done for you once you write your schema.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                       Lastly, you can update the data your user sees in real-life by using <span>subscriptions</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                      We will learn all about everything said above and more in the paragraphs to come. The point of this section was
                      to get you exicited to learn about GraphQL and how to start implementing it into your projects instead of a REST API.

                        So far, we've written no schemas or resolvers and thus both our <span>typeDefs</span> and <span>resolvers </span>

                        Alright, enough of this boring set up. Let's dive straight into some actual GraphQL. In this section we will be 
                        filling up our <span>schema.graphql</span> file with a bunch of <span>schemas</span>.

                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        In GraphQL, your data is represented by multiple schemas. Each schema describes
                        the operations and the data structures within a dataset.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        For instance, in our calorie application, we will have a <span>User schema</span> that describes all the properties
                        and methods that a <span>User</span> has.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        To better understand this, let's write out that user schema. In the <span>schema.graphql</span> file, 
                        we will write a user schema that contains an id, name, email, age, weight, and a wantsToLoseWeight boolean to check if they 
                        want to gain or lose weight.

                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        To define a schema, we must first use the <span>type</span> keyword followed by a capitalized schema name. Then, within the 
                        curly braces, we include all of the schema's properties and their respective types.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        In GraphQL, a type is either an ID, Int, Boolean, String or Float that you want a specific property to return.
                        For instance, want the property <span>name</span> to return a <span>string</span> like "Kevin" and not an integer
                        like 43. On the other hand, we want the property <span>age</span> to return an <span>integer</span> like 25 and not a string 
                        like "Micheal".
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        In GraphQL, ID, Int, Boolean, String and Float are known as <span>scalar types</span>. This is because they can only 
                        be single values. Something with type <span>String</span> can only be a single string value, 
                        while something with type <span>Int</span> can only be a single integer value. Later on, we will learn 
                        about how to make custom <span>compound types</span> which are made up of multiple scalar types.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        Notice the <span>exclamation mark</span> at the end of some of the types. These marks indicate that the following 
                        field is <span>non-nullable</span>. Therefore, we must provide these properties with an appropriate value and 
                        can't just leave them out.
                    </p>
                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        In the <span>User</span> model, the all the properties except for <span>email</span> are non-nullable. Email is the 
                        only property that we have the option to provide or not. This is important as we don't want to have a user without 
                        knowing their name, age, and weight. These information are essential to the functionality of our app and thus we 
                        must demand their existents.

                    <p className="GraphQL__description">
                        Before we move on, we must create a <span>Query</span> schema. <span>Queries</span> are what allow us to interact with 
                        our GraphQL API in the front-end. If we want to have access to our <span>User</span> schema, we must first embed it into 
                        our Query schema.

                        property names on the schema. These methods will eventually return a value that matches up with the

                        Currently, we have one huge limitation with our application. Whenever we ask for user, we get all the users back.
                        However, sometimes we may only want some of the users based on a specific criteria.

                        For instance, let's imagine that we want to calculate how many calories a user with a specific <span>id</span> should be 
                        consuming. To figure that out, we need that user's <span>age</span>, <span>weight</span>, <span>height</span>, and whether 
                        or not they <span>wantsToLoseWeight</span>.

                        With our current logic, we can fetch all that information, but it would be for every user. To selectively select exactly what 
                        user we want from our data, we can use <span>arguments</span>.

                    <div className="GraphQL__description">
                        In our <span>Query schema</span>, we can specify the presences of a parameter by doing the following:

                        Here we are saying that we can pass in a <span>id value</span> to the <span>id parameter</span>. 
                        Once we do that, we can access it within our resolvers through the <span>args</span> parameter.

                        Firstly, we are checking if the <span>id</span> was even passed in or not. If not, then we 
                        simple return all the users. However, if it was, then we have some additional steps.

                        We must first check if a user with that <span>id</span> even exists by using the <span>.some()</span> method. If they don't, then we 
                        simply <span>throw an error</span> stating that there is no user with that id. However, if there 
                        is a user with that id, we then use the <span>.filter()</span> method to find and return it.
